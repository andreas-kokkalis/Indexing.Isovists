Indexing.Isovists
=================
"Using GiST-Indexes to Speed up Visibility Calculations" is a project carried out during 2014.

The goal of the project was to generate database indexes for for two-dimentional isovists of polygons that would enable answering in real-time queries such as
"Which objects are visivble from point X?".

The project was abandoned during september 2015, due to faulty visibility calculations produced by the implemented algorithms. For detailed information about the project check the [report.pdf](https://github.com/andreas-kokkalis/Indexing.Isovists/blob/master/report.pdf) file.
